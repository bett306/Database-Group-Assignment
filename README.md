# Peer Group Assignment: E-commerce Database Design

# Objective
This challenge will help you master the art of database design🧠💾
Your group will design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and collaboratively build an e-commerce database from scratch.

 # Instructions
1 Create an ERD ✍️
Clearly define all entities (tables) and their attributes.
Understand and document the relationships between tables.
Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Use tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, dbdiagram.io, or MySQL Workbench 
2 Plan the Data Flow
Map out how data flows between entities.
As a team, discuss how the database will be structured and implemented.
Think like architects! 
3 Group Collaboration
Work together on analysis, design, and implementation.
Everyone should understand every part of the project.
Share ideas, ask questions, and keep the teamwork strong!

# Tables to Be Created
